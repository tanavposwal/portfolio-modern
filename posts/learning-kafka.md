## What is Kafka
Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform thousands of companies use for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and mission-critical applications.
Kafka is used by every company working on a large scale, for high-volume event streaming.

## Why Kafka
- Scale
- Persistence
- Ability to replay events
- Fault tolerant
